## Technical Architecture

### Frontend

- **ReactJS with TypeScript**: For type-safe component development
- **React Router**: For navigation between different sections
- **Vite**: For fast development and optimized builds

### Data Flow

1. User uploads a photo → Processed locally with feedback
2. Selection data (celebrity, car) → Stored in app state
3. Tour interactions → Tracked for personalized video creation
4. Video generation → Simulated on frontend (would connect to backend in production)
5. Share/download actions → Handled through browser APIs
